# Introduction

	Pre-trained language models performance can be improved in different ways:
 
   + _Changing the objective function : Defining new objective loss functions_
   + -Increasing the input size_
   + _Multilingual training_
   + _Adding extra knowledge_: Adding a knowledge base (KB) to provide strict rules to govern what PLM generates
   + _Changing the model size_
   + _Fine-tuning for specific application_
