learning\\nMachine learning at Coles by Advanced Analytics\\nArtificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning…?!What do all these terms I’m hearing mean?\\nArtificial intelligence \\nIs the broader concept that, as technology \\nevolves, systems will be able to be “smart” \\nand eclipse human -decision making. The \\nconcept has existed since mythology.Machine learning\\nIs a subset of artificial intelligence that \\nfocuses on algorithms which can learn, \\nwithout being explicitly programmed, to \\nsolve specific problems. This is the current \\n“art of the possible” for artificial \\nintelligence. The Advanced Analytics team \\nat Coles focuses on applying data science \\nto build machine learning models.Deep learning\\nIs a subset of machine learning which looks \\nat building artificial neural networks –e.g. \\nto recognise different types of fresh \\nproduce in a video stream. At Coles, the \\nDisruptive Tech team builds and tests these \\ncutting -edge technologies to research what \\nColes could adopt to be a technology -led \\nretailer.\\nMachine learning \\nvs\\nTraditional computer \\nprogramsTraditional computer programs are \\nbased on explicit instructions :\\ne.g. “Given a restaurant booking ,\\n•Number of people in booking = 3; and\\n•Requested highchair = TRUEIf\\n•label the customer as a\\nfamily with young child”Then\\nMachine learning algorithm get rid of such explicit instructions. \\nInstead, they learn the patterns and makes the optimal decisions \\nthemselves\\nSolution Information Based Decision Assistance Automated Decisioning\\nApproachWe build a predictive model that enables \\nbetter insight into the businessWe build a predictive model and/or an optimisation \\nalgorithm that provides recommendations or forecasts to \\nthe business (which may or may not be followed –but we \\ntrack)We build a predictive model and an optimisation \\nalgorithm that integrate directly into systems to \\nmake decisions without human intervention\\nTM RoleTeam Members use the information to \\ndraw insights and make decisionsTeam Members review the recommendation and make the \\nfinal decisionTeam Members can intervene where necessary and \\ncan steer the algorithm by tweaking the constraints \\nor objective, but the algorithms make the granular \\ndecisions\\nExample▪Availability / Lost sales\\n▪Product substitution \\n▪Lifestage  / other segmentations▪Range Optimiser\\n▪Promo App\\n▪Rem Tool▪Smarter

based on a target variable\\nDolphin\\nA key step in the overall ambition to step change the \\neffectiveness and robustness of Coles’ trade planning\\nDolphin is systematising the entire promotional planning \\nprocess by providing category teams a dedicated, flexible \\nplanning space within Promo Manager taking a cycled plan as \\nthe base.\\nSmarter Forecast is used to provide category teams with:\\n• Integrated AA forecasting at at SKU, bundle and category \\nlevel, and at a rolled up week/ category promo level\\n• BRAGG promo recommendations in the planning \\nenvironment, scoring promotions based on incremental \\nsales & margin to ensure category teams are cycling high \\nvalue promotions\\n• Future: Live, real time forecasting in the planning grid, \\nenabling what -if

Smarter \\nClearance uses SF to set individual clearance \\nprices per item/store so that stock finishes \\nclearing right when we are ready to bring in a new \\nrange to delight our customers, and to protect \\nover $10m of margin per annum.\\nSF is also used to automatically identify when we \\nshould stop replenishment of an item being \\ncleared to each store, and when we should stop \\nreplenishing our DCs from suppliers –in order to \\nmaximise margin and minimise gaps on shelves.\\n0w -7w -13w -26+wRange decisions \\nfinalised\\nCurrent 2 \\nweek \\nregrade \\nperiod‘Imp
