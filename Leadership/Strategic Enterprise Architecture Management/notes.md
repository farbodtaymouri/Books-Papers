# Chapter 1 - Introduction

* Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) is a way to deal with organizational complexity and change in an increasingly turbulent business environment.
* EAM is a discipline that helps to systematically design and develop an organization according to its strategic objectives and vision.

    * For this purpose, models are used to guide the development of Enterprise Architecture (EA) by identifying as-is models describing the current state and to-be processes describing the future EA state.
    * Each model covers one aspect of the organization, i.e., business, organization and process, information systems, and infrastructure.

## The need for Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM)

* Companies operate in an ever-changing marketplace characterized by variable customer demand patterns, fast-paced technology innovation, shortening product life cycles, and a global value chain. So there is an urgent need to adapt to the changing environment to stay ahead of the competition.
* Change affects all elements of an enterprise's value creation: products and services, corporate capabilities, etc.
* Enterprises respond to the ever-changing market by redesigning the organizational structure and processes to be efficient and effective, and by leveraging information systems to distinguish their business. In doing so, they continuously change their enterprise architecture.
* Although changes are intended to enhance an organization's competitiveness, they have some side effects:
    * If change initiatives are launched independently, with little or no coordination across the enterprise, they result in heterogeneous, incompatible, and costly changes to information systems, business processes, and organizational structures. __Even worse, additional investment in organizational redesign and information technology might not pay off, as it could produce architectural complexity. Therefore, the investment might generate risks that could even disable the business.__
* Architectural complexity manifests in various ways:
    * __Loss of transparency__: With increasing architectural complexity, managers might lack the fundamental information necessary to make decisions.
    * __Increased complexity costs__: If different technologies are used in different parts of the organization, IT investment will most likely be relatively high.
    * __Increased risks__.
    * __Inability to consistently implement strategic directions across the organization__: The more complex an enterprise architecture is, the more difficult it is to restructure or redesign it, and the more problematic it is to implement strategic changes in the organization. In the worst case, the organization might remain stagnant.
    * __Distraction from core business problems__: Complex enterprise architectures tend to tie down highly skilled professionals. __Instead of maintaining competitiveness, they are distracted by having to manage the complexity and preserve the current state.__
* Organizations that suffer from architectural complexity due to a lack of transparency in their organizational changes cannot answer the following questions:
   * How can we successfully integrate new firms after an acquisition?
   * Can we introduce new products and services using the existing business processes and underlying applications?
   * Which business units and users will be affected by an application's migration?
   * What applications and infrastructure technologies do we require to run new or redesigned business processes?
* Transparency is a prerequisite for reducing organizational complexity to gain flexibility.
* EAM seeks to maintain flexibility, cost-efficiency, and transparency in the enterprise architecture. It emphasizes the interplay between the business (business models, organizational structure, and business process models) and technology (information systems, data, and technological infrastructure). __EAM helps to systematically develop the organization to achieve its strategic objectives and vision.__
* How EAM helps improve enterprise performance:
  * __Architecture Transparency__: EAM establishes transparency by documenting the main enterprise architecture components and their interrelationships. This model is often complemented by additional management-level information such as cost, security, benefits, and compliance. Transparency is a prerequisite for identifying synergies and allocating resources efficiently.
  * __Documented Architecture Vision__: Based on the transparent view of enterprise architecture, the management team can develop the organization or part of it. A documented architecture vision represents a shared view among multiple stakeholders that enables better alignment between different layers of enterprise architecture. This alignment can be, for example, between business processes and IT systems or between IT systems and infrastructure systems. Weak alignment increases manual work, and multiple systems may be needed for one task, leading to lower data quality.
  * __Architecture Principles and Guidelines__: To guide the development of an organization, management must define architecture principles and guidelines. Modularization (microservices) and interfaces are two ways of promoting reuse, cost reduction, and scalability. Modularization also allows for outsourcing or reconfiguration of the value chain.
* EAM can reach its potential if it is aligned with strategic business objectives; therefore, EAM must be linked to the organization's strategic planning and strategic implementation processes. Hence, EAM is not an IT function but rather a strategic function.
