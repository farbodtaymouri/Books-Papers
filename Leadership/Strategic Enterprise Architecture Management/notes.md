# Chapter 1 - Introduction

* Enterprise architecture management (EAM) is a way to deal with organizational complexity and change in an increasingly turbulent business environment.
* EAM is a discipline that helps to systematically design and develop an organization according to its strategic objectives and vision.

    * For this purpose, models are used to guide the development of Enterprise Architecture (EA) by identifying as-is models describing the current state and to-be processes describing the future EA state.
    * Each model covers one aspect of the organization, i.e., business, organization and process, information systems, and infrastructure.

## The need for Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM)

* Companies operate in an ever-changing marketplace characterized by variable customer demand patterns, fast-paced technology innovation, shortening the life cycle of products, and a global value chain. So there is an urgent need to adapt to the changing environment to stay ahead of the competition.
* Change affects all elements of an enterprise's value creation: products and services, corporate capabilities, etc.
* Enterprises respond to the ever-changing market by redesigning the organization structure and processes to be efficient and effective, and by leveraging information systems to distinguish their business. Thereby continuously changing their enterprise architecture.
* Although changes are intended to power an organization's competitiveness, they have some side effects:
    * If change initiatives are launched independently, with little or no coordination across the enterprise, they result in heterogeneous, incompatible, and costly changes to information systems, business processes, and organizational structures. __Even worse, additional investment in organizational redesign and information technology might not pay off as it might produce architectural complexity. Therefore the investment might generate risks that even disable the business.
* Architectural Complexity are manifold:
    * __Loss of transparency__: With increasing archiotectural complexity the managers might lack the fundamental information necessary to make decsions
    * __Increased complexity cost__: If different technologies are used in different part of the organization, IT investment will most lielky be relatively high.
    * __Increased risks__
    * __Inability to consistenlty implement strategic directions across the organization__: the more complex an enterpsie architecture is, the more difficult to restructre or redesign it and the more problematic it is to implement strategic changes in the organization. In worst case, the organziation might stay in the current state.
    *  Distraction from core business problem: Complex enterprise architectures tend to tie down highly skilled professionals. __Instead of maintaing the competitveness, they are distracted by having to manage the complexity and preserving the current state__.
