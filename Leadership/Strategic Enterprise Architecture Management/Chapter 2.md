# Chapter 2 - Enterprise Architecture Navigator

* EAM is an instrument to address multi-dimensional fields of action and decisions.
  * A pure modeling approach with limited EAM maturity, followed by many organizations, is not enough.
* Due to the complexity of EAM, only focusing on one aspect, such as modeling or tools, will not yield results. A successful EAM initiative contains the following building blocks:
  * Top management awareness and support (a CxO agenda)
  * EAM governance and organization
  * Embedding EAM into strategic planning
  * Embedding EAM into the project life cycle
  * Embedding EAM into operations and monitoring
  * EA frameworks, modeling, and tools
  * People adoption and EAM introduction

## The EAM agenda for the chief executive officer
* What is this?
  * Organizations need to believe that EAM helps them stay competitive in an ever-changing global market space. Even with EAM-related benefits such as increased flexibility, better alignment, __the EAM initiative requires a business case and a project sponsor to get started__.
  * Top executives must invest time, money, and resources in EAM. Thus, they need to understand what EAM is and how it helps the organization. Based on that, they can define clear EAM-related objectives and create an environment in which EAM can achieve its full potential.
* Why is it important?
  * Senior leaders can provide the budget and resources necessary to make EAM successful. In addition, they need to be available when problems require escalation because their power can help to overcome conflicts and resistance that may emerge when people have to change their behavior.
  * There is a statement, __'What gets measured, gets done'__. It means it is hard to plan and control an initiative without any plan and objectives. Both the project sponsor and the EAM team need objectives because it helps to prioritize when it's simply impossible to get everything done.

* How is it related to other building blocks?
  * The best way to initiate EAM is top-down. Besides defining the EAM-related objectives by executives, they need to think about how to empower the EAM team. For this reason, this building block is closely linked to EAM governance and organization. The executives need to ensure that organizational governance is in place to empower the EAM team.

## EAM Governance and Organisation
* What is this?
  * EAM governance and organisation deal with the manner in which EAM is established in an organisation. In this context, the management must define the organisational components, roles, and committees to perform EAM-related tasks.
  * In decentralised and distributed organisations, the establishment of EAM is challenging since the management must select an EAM governance and organisation model that __balances local autonomy and global coordination.__
* Why is it important?
  * EAM is all about decision-making in the interest of an organisation as a whole. One must ensure that the right people are empowered to make EAM-related decisions and the implementation of such decisions is not hindered by an adverse organisational structure. A clear accountability framework along with a transparent escalation process and well-documented decisions can significantly leverage EAM effectiveness. __These factors are important for large organisations that struggle to align local interests to global strategic objectives__.
* How is it related to other building blocks?
  * An effective organisation and governance structure is a necessary precondition for functioning strategic planning and strategy implementation processes.
  * The organisation and governance structure define who carries out what tasks during a process, whereas the process defines how all these tasks are carried out in a logical and temporal sequence to achieve the desired outcome.

## Embedding EAM into Strategic Planning
![](https://github.com/farbodtaymouri/Books-Papers/blob/main/Leadership/Strategic%20Enterprise%20Architecture%20Management/image/EAMProcess.png)
* What is this?
  * Embedding EAM into the Enterprise architecture of an organisation is a long-term and incremental activity. In addition, __most projects carried out in an organisation either directly or partially will be affected by enterprise architecture__.
  * EAM is closely linked to the following strategic planning activities:
    * Situation analysis
    * Elaborate strategic options
    * Develop an architecture vision
    * Roadmap and migration planning
    * Project portfolio planning
    * Evaluating the architecture evolution
  * EAM is linked to the above activities in two ways:
    * Strategic planning might bring dedicated architecture initiatives for EA's structured development. Second, all other strategic initiatives must be documented in EA and analysed in terms of impacts on EA.
* Why is it important?
  * EAM not only helps in mastering the real-world complexity by analysing the existing capabilities, but also in defining smart and feasible strategies and migration paths. Secondly, if the strategic initiatives that guide the organisation's future development do not align with the strategic vision and principles, they put the organisation at risk of not meeting long-term strategic EA objectives. __If this happens, then the development of the architecture remains arbitrary and chaotic.__
  * If you look at the above plot, during portfolio and migration planning step, all small projects are converted into operational changes and later such operational changes are assessed which might be implemented aftwerads and monitored by EA.
* How is it realted to other building blocks?
 * As demonstrated in the above figure, strategic planning comes before project life cycle. EA operation and monitoring helps to introduce strategic objectives not implemented in the form of projects as operationla changes.

## Embedding EAM into the Project Life Cycle
* What is this?
  * Strategic objectives are mostly realized in the form of projects. Organizations choose to implement architectural changes in project form because projects are temporary with clear targets and dedicated resources. Therefore, they allow for the effective development of architectural components such as information systems, infrastructure, and business processes.
  * From EAM, as demonstrated above, a project has 4 stages:
    * Project set-up
    * Solution Design
    * Implementation of the solution
    * Piloting and roll-out 
* Why is it important?
  * In most cases, the projects do not go as planned. __Environmental changes, lack of understanding completely by the dev team, and requirements volatility__ are three main reasons. If the project's scope changes, its impact on EA changes as well. If there is no __constant__ monitoring of the projects and EA-related decision-making during project execution, the project outcome might not align with the intended architecture. Thus, __projects almost always influence EA in an unintended way__.
* How is it related to other parts?
  * Strategic planning initiates the above projects and EA subprocesses monitor project executions by providing relevant data about the EA components of interest via KPIs.

## Embedding EAM into Operations and Monitoring
* What is this?
  * Projects are a vehicle for large EA changes. But most changes are small. Organizations usually have dozens of projects in their portfolio and thousands of potential change requests in their change request management system. Such changes are addressed during routine EA operations.
  * There is always a risk with small changes as they might affect the functionality of applications, topology of network infrastructure, and control-flow of business process models.
  * Although the mentioned changes might be useful, they might be implemented in a way that conflicts with EA guidelines or causes unforeseen side effects. Furthermore, __they might not be documented properly, thus future decisions might not be based on complete information__.
  * Efficient handling of smaller changes in EA requires a pragmatic procedure:
    * Collect demands and changes
    * Assess changes
    * Implement changes
    * Monitor EA
  * The structured development of EA consists of hundreds or even thousands of components, including infrastructure components, applications, business processes, which cannot be done with EA models only. __Organizations use KPIs to measure certain EA characteristics such as cost efficiency, service quality, alignment, and risks__.
* Why is it important?
  * Without proper operation and process monitoring, the organization will lose control over EA. Uncontrolled modifications of EA components have the potential to derail EA plans. EA operations and processes ensure that small changes which impact EA are systematically tracked and that EA information is up to date.

## EA Frameworks, Modeling, and Tools
* What is this?
  * EA frameworks such as Zachman are useful for defining and developing the detailed architecture and governing the principles during its development and the standards guiding it.
  * EA frameworks provide guidelines, procedural models, and methodologies for structured EA development.
* Why is it important?
  * The underlying idea of developing such frameworks and models is to accelerate EAM development, reduce the risk of EAM failure, and make EAM more efficient and effective.
* How is it related to other building blocks?
  * Frameworks play an important role in all EA-related processes. They help the architect as a toolbox to serve EA tasks. Thus, there is a relationship between frameworks and all other mentioned steps (strategic planning, project life cycle, and operations and monitoring).

## People, Adoption, and Introduction of EAM
* What is this?
  * EAM is not only impacted by hard methodologies such as frameworks and modeling but also by soft factors. For example, individual resistance, incentives, and support from stakeholders play an important role in EAM development.
* Why is it important?
  * EAM requires many stakeholders to change their behavior. EAM increases transparency about EA-related decision-making and work practices. This can lead to fear that past management mistakes might come to light and that managers will be criticized for inefficient behavior and work patterns. Additionally, people tend to resist changing their habits.
