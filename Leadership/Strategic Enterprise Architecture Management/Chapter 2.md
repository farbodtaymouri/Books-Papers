# Chapter 2 - Enterprise Architecture Navigator

* EAM is an instrument to address multi-dimensional fields of action and decisions.
  * A pure modeling approach with limited EAM maturity, followed by many organizations, is not enough.
* Due to the complexity of EAM, only focusing on one aspect, such as modeling or tools, will not yield results. A successful EAM initiative contains the following building blocks:
  * Top management awareness and support (a CxO agenda)
  * EAM governance and organization
  * Embedding EAM into strategic planning
  * Embedding EAM into the project life cycle
  * Embedding EAM into operations and monitoring
  * EA frameworks, modeling, and tools
  * People adoption and EAM introduction

## The EAM agenda for the chief executive officer
* What is this?
  * Organizations need to believe that EAM helps them stay competitive in an ever-changing global market space. Even with EAM-related benefits such as increased flexibility, better alignment, __the EAM initiative requires a business case and a project sponsor to get started__.
  * Top executives must invest time, money, and resources in EAM. Thus, they need to understand what EAM is and how it helps the organization. Based on that, they can define clear EAM-related objectives and create an environment in which EAM can achieve its full potential.
* Why is it important?
  * Senior leaders can provide the budget and resources necessary to make EAM successful. In addition, they need to be available when problems require escalation because their power can help to overcome conflicts and resistance that may emerge when people have to change their behavior.
  * There is a statement, __'What gets measured, gets done'__. It means it is hard to plan and control an initiative without any plan and objectives. Both the project sponsor and the EAM team need objectives because it helps to prioritize when it's simply impossible to get everything done.

* How is it related to other building blocks?
  * The best way to initiate EAM is top-down. Besides defining the EAM-related objectives by executives, they need to think about how to empower the EAM team. For this reason, this building block is closely linked to EAM governance and organization. The executives need to ensure that organizational governance is in place to empower the EAM team.

## EAM Governance and Organisation
* What is this?
  * EAM governance and organisation deal with the manner in which EAM is established in an organisation. In this context, the management must define the organisational components, roles, and committees to perform EAM-related tasks.
  * In decentralised and distributed organisations, the establishment of EAM is challenging since the management must select an EAM governance and organisation model that __balances local autonomy and global coordination.__
* Why is it important?
  * EAM is all about decision-making in the interest of an organisation as a whole. One must ensure that the right people are empowered to make EAM-related decisions and the implementation of such decisions is not hindered by an adverse organisational structure. A clear accountability framework along with a transparent escalation process and well-documented decisions can significantly leverage EAM effectiveness. __These factors are important for large organisations that struggle to align local interests to global strategic objectives__.
* How is it related to other building blocks?
  * An effective organisation and governance structure is a necessary precondition for functioning strategic planning and strategy implementation processes.
  * The organisation and governance structure define who carries out what tasks during a process, whereas the process defines how all these tasks are carried out in a logical and temporal sequence to achieve the desired outcome.

## Embedding EAM into Strategic Planning
![](https://github.com/farbodtaymouri/Books-Papers/blob/main/Leadership/Strategic%20Enterprise%20Architecture%20Management/image/EAMProcess.png)
* What is this?
  * Embedding EAM into the Enterprise architecture of an organisation is a long-term and incremental activity. In addition, __most projects carried out in an organisation either directly or partially will be affected by enterprise architecture__.
  * EAM is closely linked to the following strategic planning activities:
    * Situation analysis
    * Elaborate strategic options
    * Develop an architecture vision
    * Roadmap and migration planning
    * Project portfolio planning
    * Evaluating the architecture evolution
  * EAM is linked to the above activities in two ways:
    * Strategic planning might bring dedicated architecture initiatives for EA's structured development. Second, all other strategic initiatives must be documented in EA and analysed in terms of impacts on EA.
* Why is it important?
  * EAM not only helps in mastering the real-world complexity by analysing the existing capabilities, but also in defining smart and feasible strategies and migration paths. Secondly, if the strategic initiatives that guide the organisation's future development do not align with the strategic vision and principles, they put the organisation at risk of not meeting long-term strategic EA objectives. __If this happens, then the development of the architecture remains arbitrary and chaotic.__
