# Chapter 2 - Enterprise Architecture Navigator

* EAM is an instrument to address multi-dimensional fields of action and decisions.
  * A pure modeling approach with limited EAM maturity, followed by many organizations, is not enough.
* Due to the complexity of EAM, only focusing on one aspect, such as modeling or tools, will not yield results. A successful EAM initiative contains the following building blocks:
  * Top management awareness and support (a CxO agenda)
  * EAM governance and organization
  * Embedding EAM into strategic planning
  * Embedding EAM into the project life cycle
  * Embedding EAM into operations and monitoring
  * EA frameworks, modeling, and tools
  * People adoption and EAM introduction

## The EAM agenda for the chief executive officer
* Why is this?
  * Organizations need to believe that EAM helps them stay competitive in an ever-changing global market space. Even with EAM-related benefits such as increased flexibility, better alignment, __the EAM initiative requires a business case and a project sponsor to get started__.
  * Top executives must invest time, money, and resources in EAM. Thus, they need to understand what EAM is and how it helps the organization. Based on that, they can define clear EAM-related objectives and create an environment in which EAM can achieve its full potential.
* Why is it important?
  * Senior leaders can provide the budget and resources necessary to make EAM successful. In addition, they need to be available when problems require escalation because their power can help to overcome conflicts and resistance that may emerge when people have to change their behavior.
  * There is a statement, __'What gets measured, gets done'__. It means it is hard to plan and control an initiative without any plan and objectives. Both the project sponsor and the EAM team need objectives because it helps to prioritize when it's simply impossible to get everything done.

* How is it related to other building blocks?
  * The best way to initiate EAM is top-down. Besides defining the EAM-related objectives by executives, they need to think about how to empower the EAM team. For this reason, this building block is closely linked to EAM governance and organization. The executives need to ensure that organizational governance is in place to empower the EAM team.
