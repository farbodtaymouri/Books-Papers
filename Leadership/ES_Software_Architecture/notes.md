# Chapter 5 - Politics 

* Politics is the art of getting things done by collaborating with other people.
* The realites in a political eccosystem need to be understood:
  * Every one has a history
  * Point of view on a particular suject based on the history
  * Organizational context on which they operate and drivse their motivations
* Play nice, the person you made unhappy may suddenly become your boss. 
* Unintended political consequences maybe the results of not fully seeing or begin aware of the true financial, organizational of a particular decision
  * Think and act carefully, and always maintain a 360 view of what is going on in the organization around you.
* Be careful of people who do not stand behind what they say when the heat turns up. People rarely change their behavior, and the are likely to repeat it over and over.
* The best way to play the game of politics __is not to play at all__.
    * If you say you are going to do something, do it.
* Not everyone will be happy all the time. You will make hard decisions.
    * Don't be afraid to ask for what you really want, you might actually get it.
* __Success at Politics = Gracious Behavior + Communication + Negotiation + Leadership__
