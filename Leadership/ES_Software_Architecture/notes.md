# Chapter 5 - Politics 

* Politics is the art of getting things done by collaborating with other people.
* The realites in a political eccosystem need to be understood:
  * Every one has a history
  * Point of view on a particular suject based on the history
  * Organizational context on which they operate and drivse their motivations
* Play nice, the person you made unhappy may suddenly become your boss. 
* Unintended political consequences maybe the results of not fully seeing or begin aware of the true financial, organizational of a particular decision
  * Think and act carefully, and always maintain a 360 view of what is going on in the organization around you.
* Be careful of people who do not stand behind what they say when the heat turns up. People rarely change their behavior, and the are likely to repeat it over and over.
* The best way to play the game of politics __is not to play at all__.
    * If you say you are going to do something, do it.
* Not everyone will be happy all the time. You will make hard decisions.
    * Don't be afraid to ask for what you really want, you might actually get it.
* __Success at Politics = Gracious Behavior + Communication + Negotiation + Leadership__

# Chapter 11 Pragmatism

* The job of an architect is to hold vision in one hand and the reality in the other hand, and to bring them together.
* __Pragmatic architecture__ is the notiation of driving toward the architectural vision whicke constraining projects to reality (tacticals). It can be achieved through
   * Risk management,
   * Scope management and
   * Communication
* Assume that you have a new project proposal that need to be delivered in 4 month and it brings lots of benefits for the company. You have three alternative architects and you have three days to come up with, __resource needs estimate, risk estimates, key assumptions and review the proposal with the affected people.__
  * Using a new open-sources technologies which the company has no experience
  * Developing everything from scratch that needs to be integrated with legacy systems
  * Hacking the legacy system but it might be gragile under heavy useage.
* What do you do regarding the three above options?
## Scope Management
* The first key area to address in pragmatic architecure is the scope management. It means that, work with the business to determine the feature priority. Note that, you must focus on features that bring ROI for the project rather than considering fancy technologies.
* Think of features as tack of cards. Priortize them in the order of customer value. This way you can execute/deliver the highest customer value earlier.
* As an architect you always have to deal with ambiguity and the more information you have the more precise decision you can make about the architecture of the project. However, no matter how many detials you seek, there will always be a level of ambiguity in decision making. The challenge is to get to a point where you are comfortable with the ambiguity and allow the project to move forward.
* To apply scope management in pragmatic architecture, you need to use agile process such as scrum or lean. Agile process lets architect to focus on the parts with les ambiguity and push ambigous parts of the project to the backlog where more information become avaialbe to address them in the next iterations or as part of the spike (time-bounded PoC). The challenge with the agile develoment method is to ensure you have some level of focus on the overall roadmap and product release. Note that the architecture of the project needs to be addressed but it doesn't need to be upfront.
