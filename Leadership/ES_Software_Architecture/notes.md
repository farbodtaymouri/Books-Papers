# Chapter 5 - Politics 

* Politics is the art of getting things done by collaborating with other people.
* The realites in a political eccosystem need to be understood:
  * Every one has a history
  * Point of view on a particular suject based on the history
  * Organizational context on which they operate and drivse their motivations
* Play nice, the person you made unhappy may suddenly become your boss. 
* Unintended political consequences maybe the results of not fully seeing or begin aware of the true financial, organizational of a particular decision
  * Think and act carefully, and always maintain a 360 view of what is going on in the organization around you.
* Be careful of people who do not stand behind what they say when the heat turns up. People rarely change their behavior, and the are likely to repeat it over and over.
* The best way to play the game of politics __is not to play at all__.
    * If you say you are going to do something, do it.
* Not everyone will be happy all the time. You will make hard decisions.
    * Don't be afraid to ask for what you really want, you might actually get it.
* __Success at Politics = Gracious Behavior + Communication + Negotiation + Leadership__

# Chapter 11 Pragmatism

* The job of an architect is to hold vision in one hand and the reality in the other hand, and to bring them together.
* __Pragmatic architecture__ is the notiation of driving toward the architectural vision whicke constraining projects to reality (tacticals). Note that, Pragmatic Enterprise Architecture Framework (PEAF) is frame work for implementing enterprise strategies. From a very high-level, It can be achieved through
   * __Risk management__,
   * __Scope management and__,
   * __Communication__
* Assume that you have a new project proposal that need to be delivered in 4 month and it brings lots of benefits for the company. You have three alternative architects and you have three days to come up with, __resource needs estimate, risk estimates, key assumptions and review the proposal with the affected people.__
  * Using a new open-sources technologies which the company has no experience
  * Developing everything from scratch that needs to be integrated with legacy systems
  * Hacking the legacy system but it might be gragile under heavy useage.
* What do you do regarding the three above options?
## Scope Management
* The first key area to address in pragmatic architecure is the scope management. It means that, work with the business to determine the feature priority. Note that, you must focus on features that bring ROI for the project rather than considering fancy technologies.
* Think of features as tack of cards. Priortize them in the order of customer value. This way you can execute/deliver the highest customer value earlier.
* As an architect you always have to deal with ambiguity and the more information you have the more precise decision you can make about the architecture of the project. However, no matter how many detials you seek, there will always be a level of ambiguity in decision making. The challenge is to get to a point where you are comfortable with the ambiguity and allow the project to move forward.
* To apply scope management in pragmatic architecture, you need to use agile process such as scrum or lean. Agile process lets architect to focus on the parts with les ambiguity and push ambigous parts of the project to the backlog where more information become avaialbe to address them in the next iterations or as part of the spike (time-bounded PoC). The challenge with the agile develoment method is to ensure you have some level of focus on the overall roadmap and product release. Note that the architecture of the project needs to be addressed but it doesn't need to be upfront.
## Risk Management
* The second key area of pragmatic architecture is the risk management. It is good to spend time early at the discovery phase of the project to identify, document and mitigate as many as potential risks as possible.
* __For any architectural approach there are a range of possible implenetations__. You need to ask the following questions to understand the difference between possible and feasible:
  * Which resource will implement that? Do they need training
  * Has this architectural pattern already implemented in the company, industry?
  * Which architectural spike might be needed to remove any high-level risks?
  * Do you understand the nature of sclaing the solution? (From the application server, database server, network perspective, queuing perspective)
  * Do you have  or can you build appropriate tool to monitor that?
  * Have you accounted for any reporting needs?
  * Are there any legal or regulatory issues (RAI)?
  * Do you understand when the project needs to be delivered?
  * How does this project align with the companis strategic long-term goals?
  * Does the project requires specific software packages?
*  __One way to increase the feasibility of the project to minimize the number of new things__ (services, technologies) you are injecting into the organization or to sequence thechanges in a stable manner. Note that, bringin in new things is fun, but trying to get them operationalized is nearly always a challenge.
*  Note that as an architect whenever you make any decision, __assess the risk__ and the __impact__ of that decision by asking the following questions (e.g., via KDD):
   * What are the operational implication of this decision?
   * Does it enable the project the meet it's delivery faster?
   * Will the quality of the project affected?
   * What are the maintenace cost of implication of this decision?
   * What are the development cost of this decision?
* Note that the number of risks associated with a project might be high. However, focus on the risks that has high chance of happening -such as a new technology failing to deliver, a dependent project failing to deliver. As an architect you should have the ability to plan on how to address them and which alternatives must be considred if and when they happen.
* Another way to manage the risk when you need to make a decision about the feasibility of a particualt architectural approach (i.e., using AI search in the chatbot). __Take time to do a time-bounded architectural spike (PoC)__.Also consider the following guidlines:
  * Place time-boundary on investigation
  * Understand the key elements that require investigation
  * Avoid the spike to turn into the real solution
  * Document the results
  * Get the right resources
 ## Communication
 * The thid key area of pragmatic architecture is comminication. The architect must have a __clear, consistent, and continuous__ communication. Note that, any communication gap will be filled by others so __stay on top of the comminication process ecven if you are extraordineray busy__.
 * Note that, when a software is built only a limited variability and flexibility can be realized. Take time to document decisions along the way. Ensure that the decision log is properly distributed so that there is no surprise.
 * Whenever you present alternatives as part of making decision, your ability to clearly articulate the avilable options and which one you recommend will produce a great starting point for a conversation. Don't be afraid of the solution you recommend and show you have a detaild analysis about that decision. __If the don't accepted your recommended solution, owns the one they recommend but make sure the decision makers understand the consequence of that decision (delay, cost, tech debt, etc.)__
