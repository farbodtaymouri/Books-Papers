# Introduction

Workload tasks can be categorised into three main areas: Application Development, Data Handling, and AI model management. Each category should adopt industry-proven operational methodologies such as __DataOps, MLOps, GenAIOps, and DevOps__.

DevOps activites cover the lifecycle of application development through Continous Integration and Continous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and monitoring. DataOps managing the data lifecycle by streamlining the ETL/ELT. DataOpes focuses on data flow performance, efficiney of cleaning and monitoring pipelines for anomalies.

AI workloads are non-determinstic in nature, hence such workloads need process that can manage the unpredictibility of AI outputs, hence MLOps which opertionalises the ML workloads for model training, tuning, and inferencing are required. GenAIOps a subset of MLOps targets Genai solutions and it involves tasks like model discovery and  refining pretrained models with enrished data.

Overal goal of xOps is to deliver capability with efficient operations through the lifecycle of development. The expected outcomes are:

* Repeatable process with consistent results
* Sustained accuracy of the models over time
* Efficient governance that minimize the risks
* Change management process for dapating to model drift.
__Automation and monitoring are they operational strategies__ to achieve such goals.

This article focuses on the design strategies for operations and provides tool recommendation.
