# AI Workload on Azure
* In the context of Well-Architected Framework, the term workload refferes to the collection of application, resources, custom codes, AI models and supporting infrastructure that functions togather to define a business outcome.
* The Azure Well-Architected framework focuses on ethical functionality, adapting to fast evolving AI technologies and staying relevant and explainable. Note that, applying __Well-Architected Framework Pillars (Reliability, Security, Opereational Excellecen, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimisation)__ ant any decision point ensure the system is reliable, secured, efficient and cost effective.
* Before to begin the design strategy for an inititative consider the following points:
  *  Whether to use discriminative AI or Generative AI?
  *  Evaluate your build vs buy option. If a generic responses are required then a prebuilt model is or an AI-service solution should be sufficient for the workload, but if you need data specific to your buinsess or have compliance requrments it is better to create a custom model. Consider the following aspects for seelcting between buy vs build:
      * __Data Control__: Custom model gives you better control over sensitve data
      * __Customization__: Custom model gives better flesxibility for unique needs.
      * __Cost and upkeep__: Custom models need ongoing maintenance and resources
      * __Performance__: Prebuilt models and AI services are better at scaling and providing lower latency
      * __Expertise__: Custom models needs expert people to work on them. Pre-built models are easier to deploy with less technical backgorund
   
* What are the challenges with the AI Workloads
    * __Compute Cost__: AI functions can be expensive because of high-compute needs and compute needs can vary according to the workload design.
    * __Security and Compliance Requirment__: Off-the-shelf solutions might not meet your security and compliance beeds
    * __Volume of data__
    * __Model Decay__: Model can degarde over time (data shift or model shift concept). Hence testing AI workloads needs to be ongoing and it is challengeing
    * __Peace of AI Innovation__: Adding a new technology to the current stsck needs to impove user-expericne and don't just add complexity to the system
    * __Ehtical Requirments__
* How to use Well-Architected Framework for AI Workloads
    * Start with the __Design methodology__
    * Proceede with the __Design Principles__ to see how the design methodology alings with the core Well-Architected Framework pillars
    * Focus on the __Desing Areas__ (MLOPS, GENAI) that has the biggest effect on your solution
    * Use Assessemtn Review Tool https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/ai/assessment to evlaluate the readiness of your AI workload.
 
      
# Design Methodology for AI Workloads

If you desing a capability or intoduce and improvement, evaluate the change from the methodology perpective. Does your change affect the user experience? Is your change felxible enough to adapt to the future innovations? Does it disrupt the experimentation flow?

* __Design with an Experimental Mindset__: Design your AI workload or system as if experimentation is oart of their DNA. AI workloads rarely work perfectly in the first run, and hence they got better by adding feedback, trials etc. This desing methodology includes two loops: __ineer loop__ where the focus is on model training and evalaution in dev/test and __outer Loop__ or continues montoring and re-training in production.
  
* __Design responsibly__: You should embedd the Responsbile AI principles in your design as the users trust your system. __Content Moderation__ is the key strategy in respoinsible desing on AI systems (evalautiong the input/out of the system).  __Ethical data management__ is central to responsible design. The user trust you to ensure that no perosnal information is kept or if it is kept it is with their consents to ensure the data is protected which helps ensure privacy and security are in place.

* __Design for Explanability__: AI models must be explainable. you should be able __to trace the origin of data, the inference process and the journey of data from the source to the serve layer__.

* __Stay ahead of model Decay__: model decay is common in AI workloads and can happen time to time without any changes to the code. sometimes it can happen suddenly due to technology changes. Such deterioration affects various aspects of the system such as data_ingestion speed, data quality,monitoring speed.

* __Design for adaptability__: Be aware that what you build today might become obsolte quickly and keep that in mind when you make decisions and create process. It is important to recogniae the components that have limited lifespan. Adopt a __Pause-and-think__ approach that focuses on the research for the model discovery, programming libraries, frameworks, etc.


# Design Principles for AI Workloads on Azure
It is essential to consider all Azure Well-Architected Frameworks pillars collectively, including their trade-off and apply each pillar to the functional and non-functional requirments of the workload.

## Reliability
Outages and malfunctions are serious to any workloads. A reliable workload must survive and continue to consistently provides its inteded functionality. It must be __resilient__ so that it can detect and recover from the failure whithin and accepted timeframe. It must also be __available__ so that users can access the workload during the promised time at the promised quality level. Note that, Workload architecture should consider reliability assurance in __application coide, infrastructure, and operations__.

When running any AI workloads on Azure the general reliability considerations in Azure Well-Architected framework must be applied. However, for AI workloads the reliability of the __model training, hosting, and inferencing__ is important.

| **Design principle** | **Considerations** |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Mitigate single points of failure** | Build redundancy into critical components. Use multiple instances or nodes with built-in fault tolerance and high-availability features. |
| **Conduct failure mode analysis** | Regularly analyze potential failure modes. Use patterns like **Bulkhead**, **Circuit Breaker**, and **Retry** to isolate failures and handle transient errors. |
| **Balance reliability objectives** | Align reliability between the model, APIs, and data store. Ensure failover and redundancy across dependent components. |
| **Design for operational reliability** | Automate frequent updates and model retraining. Balance freshness of data with the cost of updates. |
| **Design for a reliable user experience** | Load-test your workload. Use asynchronous UI design and feedback elements to manage latency or intermittent issues. |

## Security
Since AI workloads and models might use sensitive production data to produce relevant results, hence robust securty measures must be implemented at all layers of the architecture.

| **Design principle** | **Considerations** |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| **Earn user trust.** | Integrate content safety at every stage of the lifecycle by using custom code, tools, and effective security controls.<br><br>Remove unneeded personal and confidential information at all data storage points, including aggregated data stores, search indexes, caches, and applications. Maintain this level of security consistently throughout the architecture.<br><br>Implement content moderation that inspects data in both directions and filters out inappropriate or offensive content. |
| **Protect data at rest, in transit, and in use, according to the sensitivity requirements of the workload.** | Use platform-level encryption with Microsoft-managed or customer-managed keys on all data stores. Determine where you need higher levels of encryption and apply double encryption if necessary.<br><br>Ensure all traffic uses HTTPS for encryption, and clearly define TLS termination points at each hop.<br><br>Protect the model itself to prevent attackers from extracting sensitive training information. Consider **homomorphic encryption** that allows inferencing on encrypted data. |
| **Invest in robust access management for identities (user and system) that access the system.** | Implement **RBAC** (role-based access control) and/or **ABAC** (attribute-based access control) for both control and data planes.<br><br>Maintain proper identity segmentation to help protect privacy, and only allow access to content that identities are authorized to view. |
| **Protect the integrity of the design by implementing segmentation.** | Provide private networking for access to centralized repositories for container images, data, and code assets.<br><br>When sharing infrastructure with other workloads, create segmentation — for example, if hosting inference in **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, isolate the node pool from other APIs and workloads. |
| **Conduct security testing.** | Develop a detailed test plan that includes tests for detecting unethical behavior whenever changes are introduced to the system.<br><br>Integrate AI components into your existing security testing — e.g., include the inferencing endpoint in your regular public endpoint tests.<br><br>Consider live security tests (penetration, red-team, or chaos exercises) to detect and mitigate potential vulnerabilities early. |
| **Reduce the attack surface by enforcing strict user access and API design.** | Require authentication for all inferencing endpoints, including system-to-system calls. Avoid anonymous endpoints and use least-privilege design. |


## Cost Optimisation

The goal of cost optimisation is to maximise the investment, not necessarily to reduce the cost. Note that, every architectural choice creates both direct and indirect financial implications. Understand the cost associated with "buy-vs-build", technology choice, billing models, liscening ,training, and operational expenses.

| **Design principle** | **Key considerations (summarized)** |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Determine cost drivers through cost modeling** | Identify major cost factors early: **data volume**, **query frequency**, **throughput**, and **dependency costs**. Estimate data indexing, processing, and query patterns to understand compute and storage demand. Larger datasets and high query complexity increase costs. Assess throughput tiers and dependency pricing (e.g., external APIs, model hosting). |
| **Pay for what you intend to use** | Choose technology and tiers that fit real usage — avoid over-provisioning. Prefer **elastic compute** for variable workloads and **spot pricing** for non-critical or interruptible training. Don’t pay for idle or oversized SKUs. Test and benchmark to find the best balance of **performance vs. cost**. |
| **Use what you pay for. Minimize waste.** | Monitor utilization continuously. Shut down, scale down, or deallocate unused resources. Optimize for **write-once, read-many** patterns to reduce storage costs. Simulate endpoints instead of using paid inference for testing. Assign **cost accountability** to teams and automate utilization alerts. |
| **Optimize operational costs** | Automate frequent retraining tasks to reduce manual effort and ensure consistency. Use slightly older or sampled data when acceptable to lower compute costs. For **offline training**, use cheaper compute (e.g., low-priority VMs or spot clusters). Periodically delete obsolete data or features to minimize long-term storage costs. |


* Note that there is a trade-off between Cost-Optimisation and Performance Efficiency in many asspects like the number in index in a databse. The more index the better and quicker retrival but it comes at more cost.
* Trade-off between Cost-Optimization and Operational Excellence where training an ML model in the pre-prod envrionment with prod data reduces the cost (no need for re-training in prod envrionment) but impact Opercational Excellence since more protectetion needs to be applied at the lower environment.

## Operationa Excellence

__The overal objective of Operational Excellence is to deliver the capabilites efficently throughout the development lifecycle__. To achieve this goal, __repeatable process__ that suppport the design methodology of experimentation to improve model performance must be established. Operational Excellnece for AI workloads is also about maintaning the accuracy of the model over time, implemntating effective monitoring in place, implementaing governance in place, and developing change management process to adopt model drift.

| **Design principle** | **Key considerations (summarized)** |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Foster a continuous learning and experimentation mindset** | Build operations around modern methodologies such as **DevOps**, **DataOps**, **MLOps**, and **GenAIOps**. Encourage early collaboration between development, data, and operations teams to align on acceptable model performance and create feedback loops for rapid improvement. |
| **Choose technologies that minimize operational burden** | Prefer **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** solutions over self-hosted options to simplify deployment, automate workflows, and reduce day-to-day operational complexity. |
| **Create automated monitoring and alerting systems** | Establish clear quality metrics early in the lifecycle. Use experiment-tracking tools to capture parameters, environments, and results. Implement dashboards and actionable alerts so operators can detect and resolve issues quickly. Ensure logging and auditability are built in. |
| **Automate the detection and mitigation of model decay** | Continuously evaluate **model drift** with automated tests. Configure monitoring systems to trigger alerts when predictions deviate from expected results. Use tools that can automatically retrain or update models and adapt data pipelines or logic as use cases evolve. |
| **Implement safe deployments** | Use **blue-green** or **side-by-side** deployments to avoid downtime. Rigorously test before release to confirm configuration, compliance, and performance. Maintain a rollback plan for emergency situations. |
| **Continuously evaluate the user experience in production** | Gather user feedback and interaction data (with proper consent) to assess usability, accuracy, and performance. Use this data to improve the workload iteratively while maintaining compliance and privacy standards. |

## Performance Efficiency

Performance Efficinecy in general is the ability of the workload to adapt to changing demands by scalling up to meet the increased load without impacting the user experience and scalling down accordingly.

In AI workloads more specific metrics are required to be reviwed for this pillar. Model Performance of an AI workload is influcned by operations like experiment tracking and data processing. Other metrics that AI workloads might be monitored for are the accuracy, preceision, fairness where the AI workload need to adapt changes in any of the metnioned metrics without impacting user experience. In addition, the performance of the platform and application components that support the model is crucial.

| **Design principle** | **Key considerations (summarized)** |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Establish performance benchmarks** | Conduct regular performance testing across all architectural layers and define acceptable targets. Treat benchmarking as an **ongoing process**, not a one-time task. Start with baseline prediction performance, measure continuously, and refine models to meet evolving expectations. |
| **Evaluate resource needs to meet performance targets** | Understand workload characteristics to select the right **compute platform** and **SKU size**. Use **load testing** for capacity planning and to decide when to use GPU-optimized compute (for model training/fine-tuning) versus general-purpose SKUs (for orchestration). Choose data platforms that handle concurrent reads/writes efficiently. Different inference servers have unique latency and throughput profiles—select ones aligned with your performance baselines. |
| **Collect and analyze performance metrics; identify bottlenecks** | Continuously analyze **telemetry and logs** to ensure throughput and latency goals are met. Track metrics such as query latency, throughput, and accuracy under load. Use orchestration and service call telemetry to pinpoint delays (e.g., CPU vs. network time). Monitor **UI engagement metrics** to assess user experience—multimodal workloads (voice, video) may require special tuning for response times. |
| **Continuously improve benchmark performance** | Automate collection and analysis of performance metrics and alerts. Feed production quality data back into retraining pipelines to maintain model accuracy and responsiveness over time. |
